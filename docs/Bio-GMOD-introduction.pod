=head1 Bio::GMOD: A Unified API To Model Organism Databases

Bio::GMOD is a suite of Perl modules that provides a unified
programming interface to Model Organism Databases.  These databases
house a wealth of information that extends beyond the primary genomic
sequences of the organisms on which they focus.

This document was derived from a talk given at the May 2005 Generic
Model Organism Database meeting in Menlo Park, CA.

=head1 Current Problems

	Need to be knowledgable in both database structure and terminology
	Difficult to fetch similar/related data across sites

=head1 Objectives

	insulate end users from changes in data schemas
	provide unified API to wealth of data housed in MODs

=head1 Solutions

	open-ended defaults - can generically create as necessary

=head1 Limitations

	one instance, one MOD
	little movement between classes
